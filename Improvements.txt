Here are some additional features you can consider adding to the HTML 147 Colours code:

1. Color Search Functionality: Implement a search bar or filter options that allow users to search for specific colours by name, code, or hue. This can make it easier for users to find and select the desired colour from the extensive palette.

2. Color Copy Functionality: Include a button or functionality that allows users to easily copy the selected colour's code to the clipboard. This can save time and effort by eliminating the need to manually copy the code.

3. Color Palette Generator: Provide a feature that generates complementary or harmonious colour palettes based on the selected colour. This can assist users in creating visually cohesive designs by suggesting compatible colours.

4. Color Shades and Tints: Extend the code to display different shades or tints of each colour. This can provide users with a broader range of options and help them create subtle variations in their designs.

5. Color Preview: Allow users to preview the selected colour in real-time on a sample element, such as a box or a text snippet. This immediate visual feedback can assist users in making informed decisions.

6. Color Information: Include additional information about each colour, such as its RGB values, hex code, and accessibility contrast ratio. This can be helpful for users who require precise colour specifications or need to ensure accessibility compliance.

7. Colour Scheme Export: Enable users to export their chosen colour palette as a CSS file or code snippet for easy integration into their projects. This can streamline the workflow and facilitate the reuse of colour schemes.

8. Responsive Design: Ensure that the HTML code and colour display are responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This will enhance the user experience for individuals accessing the colour palette from various devices.
